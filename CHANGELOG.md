Tests are as follows:

| Test      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| add-1     | Add 100k datoms to an empty DB, one datom per transaction |
| add-5     | Add 20k entities to an empty DB, 5 datoms per transaction, 100k datoms total |

| init      | “Fast” datascript DB creation from an already sorted array of datoms (used in DB deserialization), 100k datoms |
| retract-5 | Retract 20k entities from a DB with 100k datoms. Each entity removes 5 datoms. 1 entity per tx. |
| q1        | Query with 1 clause over a DB with 100k datoms, ~12k tuples in resultset `[:find ?e :where [?e :name "Ivan"]]` |

For Datomic an `datomic:mem://` database was used.

What we see:

- 20..40% faster transactions,
- 75% faster deserialization (db-init),
- No significant change on queries,
- JVM transactions are more than twice as fast as V8,
- JVM queries are 3-4 times as fast as V8,
- DataScript transactions are 25..70% faster that Datomic in-memory. Query times vary.

# 0.13.1

- Guard `conn?` will check that value is derefable instead of checking for `(instance? Atom)`

# 0.13.0

- **[ BREAKING ] Main namespace to include is now `datascript.core`, not `datascript`**
- [ BREAKING ] Old `datascript.core` (internal namespace) was renamed to `datascript.db`
- [ BREAKING ] `datascript.shim` (internal namespace) was renamed to `datascript.arrays`

Motivations:

- Usage of top-level namespaces is discouraged and even generates a warning in CLJS.
- Better sooner than later.
- 0.13 seems like a great number for this sort of release.

Migration procedure:

- Just change `(require '[datascript :as d])` to `(require '[datascript.core :as d])` and you’re good to go.

For the sake of easy migration, there’re no other changes in this release. Just renamings.

# 0.12.2

- Fix null pointer exception when `contains?` is called with an entity (PR #114, thx [Kevin Lynagh](https://github.com/lynaghk))

# 0.12.1

- `db-init` respects `:db/index` property

# 0.12.0

[ BREAKING ] Introducing new `:db/index` schema attribute:

- Attributes are not put to AVET _by default_ anymore
- Following attributes are put to AVET:

  - `:db/index true`
  - `:db/unique :db.unique/identity`
  - `:db/unique :db.unique/value`
  - `:db/valueType :db.type/ref`

- All attributes put to AVET should be comparable. Note: maps and list are not comparable by default, vectors are compared value-by-value
- [ BREAKING ] Min/max aggregation functions will only work on a comaparable values

Benefits:

- You can finally store _any_ trash easily and reliably in DataScript database: maps, vectors, functions, JS objects. It doesn’t even have to be comparable. Just do not mark it as `:db/index` and do not make it `:db.cardinality/many`
- Faster transactions. There’s ⅓ less indexes to fill
- Good defaults. Most cases where you’ll probably use AVET (lookup by value)—lookup refs, external ids, references—they are all indexed by default

Caveats:

- Your code may break (see below)
- Queries can do lookup by value event without `:db/index` attribute, but it’ll be slower

Migration procedure:

- Check your code for `datoms`, `seek-datoms` calls with `:avet` index, and `index-range` call
- Check your queries to see if they utilize AVET index. It happens when you use this pattern: `[?free-var <constant-attr> <constant-value>]`
- Mark necessary attributes with `:db/index true` in the schema

# 0.11.5

- Ported BTSet to JVM

Performance numbers so far ([raw data](https://gist.github.com/tonsky/9da339f87113e1f1a395)):

- queries with single clause, no join: 30–50% faster 
- queries with joins: ~50% slower

- [ BREAKING ] Custom aggregate fns must be called via special syntax (`aggregate` keyword): `(q '[:find (aggregate ?myfn ?e) :in $ ?myfn ...])`. Built-in aggregates work as before: `(q '[:find (count ?e) ...]`
- Return nil from `entity` when passed nil eid (issue #47)
- Transaction data is now validated, with proper error messages (also fixes #48)

# 0.7.2

- Fixed a bug with function call after function relation was filtered out (issue #44) 

# 0.7.1

- Fixed a bug when emtpy coll in input was not creating empty relation

# 0.7.0

- BTSet and its slices (returned by `datoms`/`seek-datoms`/`index-range` calls) now support fast reverse iteration via `reverse`.
- `(datascript/datom e a v & [tx added])` call for creating new datoms
- Added missing aggregate funs: `avg`, `median`, `variance`, `stddev` and `count-distinct` (issue #42, thx [@montyxcantsin](https://github.com/montyxcantsin))
- `min` and `max` aggregates use comparator instead of default js `<` comparison
- Fixed a bug when fn inside a query on empty relation returned non-empty result
- Filtered DB support via `filter`

# 0.6.0

- [ BREAKING ] Entity ids and transaction ids now have to be numbers, attributes can only be keywords (strings if used from JS)
- New method `init-db` for fast creation of DB from existing datoms (useful for e.g. initialization from serialized state)
- Improved performance of `transact!` (~20%) and initial database population (`init-db`, `db-from-reader`, ~800%)

# 0.5.2

- Externs provided via `deps.cljs` — no need to manually specify externs when using datascript dependency

# 0.5.1

- Ability to pass inputs (predicates/functions bindings) down to rules (issues #28 #29)

# 0.5.0

- Javascript version is now packaged as a proper CommonJS/RequireJS module (include via script tag still supported) (issue #39)
- Published to npm: [npmjs.org/package/datascript](https://www.npmjs.org/package/datascript)
- [ BREAKING ] Javascript namespace is renamed from `datascript.js` to `datascript`

# 0.4.2

- Reference transaction id inside transaction by using `:db/current-tx` instead of entity id (issue #32)
- You can get id of transaction from `TxReport`: `(get-in tx-report [:tempids :db/current-tx])`
- Ability to pass arbitrary metadata along with transaction (third argument to `transact!`) and read it in listener callback (`:tx-meta` key of `TxReport`) (issue #32)

# 0.4.1

- Added `:db.fn/cas` transaction function (issue #20, thx [@montyxcantsin](https://github.com/montyxcantsin))
- Added `get-some`, `get-else`, `misssing?` query functions (issue #21, thx [@montyxcantsin](https://github.com/montyxcantsin))
- Fixed `touch` breaking entity cache (issue #17)
- Added `ground` fn (issue #25)
- Fixed query predicate/fn calls without free variables
- Retract incoming entity references on `:db.fn/retractEntity` (issue #18)
- You can now use reverse relation name when transacting entity as a map

# 0.4.0

Cosmetic changes to better mimic Datomic API. Useful for sharing code between Datomic and DataScript:

- Added `tempid`, `resolve-tempid`, `db`, `transact`, `transact-async`, `index-range`, `squuid`, `squuid-time-millis`
- [ BREAKING ] renamed `transact` to `with`, `with` to `db-with`

# 0.3.1

- Optimized speed of DB’s `equiv` and `hash`, Datom’s `hash`
- Entity’s `touch` call accessible through `datascript` namespace
- Accept sets in entity maps as values for `:db.cardinality/many` attributes

# 0.3.0

Proper entities implementation:

- Entities are now lazy and implement usual Map protocols
- [ BREAKING ] When accessing attribute of `:db/valueType :db.type/ref`, its value will be automatically expanded to entites, allowing for recursive exploration of entities graphs (e.g. `(-> (d/entity db 42) :parent :parent :children)`)
- Entities support backwards navigation (e.g. `(:person/_friends (d/entity db 42))`)

# 0.2.1

- Externs file now can be referred as `:externs [datascript/externs.js"]`

# 0.2.0

Big performance improvements:

- New B-tree based indexes
- New set-at-a-time, hash-join powered query and rules engine
- Queries now up to 10× times faster
- You can specify DB for rule call (like `($db follows ?e1 ?e2)`)
- Datoms are required to have integer id and keyword attributes, but no restriction on types of values

# 0.1.6

- Clojure reader support (pr/read) for DB and Datom

# 0.1.5

- `datoms` and `seek-datoms` API calls
- referencing other entities’ tempids in transaction data (issue #10)

# 0.1.4

- Transactor functions via `:db.fn/call` (thx [@thegeez](https://github.com/thegeez))
- Vanilla JS API bindings
- [ BREAKING ] Schema keywords namespaced on a par with Datomic schema

# 0.1.3

- `entity` added
